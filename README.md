## 📖 About

This repository is a comprehensive collection of "Hello, World!" programs written in **100 different programming languages**. 

From industry giants like **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**, to historical classics like **COBOL** and **Fortran**, and even esoteric languages like **Brainfuck** and **LOLCODE**.

## ⚡ How It Was Built

This entire repository structure and all source code files were automatically generated using a Python automation script. The script iterates through a dictionary of languages and syntax, creating the files and the directory structure programmatically.

### The Generator
You can regenerate this project by running the included script:

```bash
python3 generate_top_100.py

📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized as a flat list of files for easy browsing. File extensions match their respective languages.
